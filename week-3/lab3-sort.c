sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It is extremely fast in the sorted number series (Omega(n) as best case scenario) but overall slow

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Fastest of all algorithms for all categories of number series. However, it took more time on the sorted 50000.
Even if the array is perfectly sorted, the algorithm still need to split and recombine.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Time is between Merge and Bubble sort. Timing are closed for all 50000 numbers which coincides with Tetha(n2). It needs to go through
all of the elements of an array.
